## When to use

Use this skill when you are:
- Creating a new Pack (bundle) to share a strategy/script/skill/contract UI
- Adding a static applet UI to a pack
- Publishing a new pack version
- Emitting signals/receipts to make a pack page feel “alive”

## How to use

- [rules/manifest.md](rules/manifest.md) - `wfpack.yaml` schema + required fields for MVP
- [rules/applet.md](rules/applet.md) - Static applet requirements + build output expectations
- [rules/build-and-publish.md](rules/build-and-publish.md) - `wayfinder pack build/publish` + required config/env vars
- [rules/signals.md](rules/signals.md) - `wayfinder pack signal emit` patterns
- [rules/security.md](rules/security.md) - MVP hosting constraints and safe defaults
